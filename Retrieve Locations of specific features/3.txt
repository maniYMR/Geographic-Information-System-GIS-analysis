This SQL query calculates the percentage usage of each land type (fclass) in the "gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1" table. Here's an analysis of the query plan:

Finalize GroupAggregate: The server is completing an aggregation grouped by the "fclass" column. The actual execution time indicates the time taken to finish the final grouping and aggregation.

Group Key: Data is grouped by the "fclass" column.

InitPlan 1 (returns $0): This subplan returns a single value used in the outer query's calculations. It's executed before the main query.

Aggregate: An aggregation is performed to calculate the total count of rows in the table, which is used to calculate the percentage of each land type.

Index Only Scan using gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1_pkey: The database efficiently calculates the total number of rows using an index-only scan. The "Heap Fetches: 0" indicates that all necessary data was retrieved directly from the index without accessing the table (heap), resulting in high efficiency.

Gather Merge: This operation is part of the parallel processing mechanism, where results from individual workers are combined.

Workers Planned/Launched: Two parallel worker processes were planned and used for the operation.

Sort: Before merging the results, they are sorted based on the "fclass" column.

Sort Method: The "quicksort" method is used, which is efficient for in-memory sorting.

Memory: A small amount of memory (25kB) is used, indicating that the sort operation is entirely in-memory and efficient.

Partial HashAggregate: The initial stage of aggregation is performed by each parallel worker, aggregating data based on the "fclass" column.

Group Key: Data is grouped by "fclass."

Batches and Memory Usage: This indicates that the aggregation was performed in a single batch and used a small amount of memory.

Parallel Seq Scan on gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1: A parallel sequential scan is done on the table to read the rows needed for the aggregation.

Filter: No filter is applied in this step because the query is aggregating over all rows.

Planning Time: PostgreSQL generates the execution plan for the query efficiently, taking only 0.181 milliseconds.

Execution Time: The actual execution time to execute the query and retrieve the results is approximately 137.3 milliseconds, which is fast.

Overall Analysis:

The query effectively utilizes parallel processing to calculate the percentage usage of each land type.

An index-only scan for counting total rows improves efficiency.

Sorting and aggregation are done in-memory, enhancing performance.

The query's usage of parallel workers suggests the dataset is large, and PostgreSQL efficiently divides the work.

The execution plan demonstrates well-optimized performance, with the most resource-intensive part being parallel sequential scans.

The quick execution time indicates a well-configured server.

For continued performance, monitoring of execution plans is recommended if the dataset grows or similar queries are frequent.
