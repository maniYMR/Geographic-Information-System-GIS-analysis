The query is designed to aggregate land use data from the "gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1" table, summarizing the area based on the combination of "fclass" (land use category) and the type of geometry. The aggregation specifically focuses on cases where a name is specified.

Here's an analysis of the query plan:

Finalize GroupAggregate: This step marks the completion of the aggregation process. The query execution is divided into two phases: an initial parallel aggregation (Partial HashAggregate) performed by multiple workers and a final aggregation step to consolidate the results.

Group Key: Data is grouped based on the "fclass" field (land use category) and the type of geometry. These columns serve as the basis for aggregating the total area.

Gather Merge: This stage combines the results obtained from parallel workers. PostgreSQL utilizes parallel execution, where workers perform part of the computation, and the coordinator node merges their results.

Workers Planned and Launched: The query was planned to use two workers for parallel processing, and indeed, two workers were launched as intended.

Sort: Before the final aggregation, intermediate results are sorted based on the group key. Sorting is crucial for the subsequent GroupAggregate step to process groups correctly.

Sort Key and Method: The sorting operation is performed based on "fclass" and the output of the GeometryType(geom) function. It uses the quicksort method, which is efficient for in-memory sorting.

Memory Usage in Sort: Each worker's memory usage for the sorting operation is relatively small (26kB), suggesting that the dataset size for each worker is manageable and does not require disk spilling.

Partial HashAggregate: Each worker conducts an initial aggregation of their data subset. The Group Key indicates the columns used for grouping.

Batches and Memory Usage in HashAggregate: The execution shows efficient memory usage with no signs of needing to write data to disk.

Parallel Seq Scan on gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1: Workers perform a parallel sequential scan on the table, filtering rows where the "name" is not null.

Filter and Rows Removed by Filter: The filtering operation excludes a substantial number of rows (specifically, 39,992) that lack a name, thus eliminating them from the result set.

Planning and Execution Time: The query planning process is extremely fast (0.124 ms). The overall execution time for the query is approximately 759 ms, which is reasonable considering the complexity of the operations performed.

Overall Analysis:

The query efficiently harnesses parallel processing to compute total land use area for different categories, grouping by "fclass" and geometry type. The presence of a significant number of rows removed by the filter suggests that indexing the "name" column could further enhance performance for similar queries. The quicksort sorting method and memory usage indicate that the dataset is effectively managed in memory without the need for disk I/O, contributing to efficient execution
