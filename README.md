Project Title: Geographic Information System (GIS) Analysis

Project Description:
Our project involves the comprehensive analysis of geographic data, including maps and spatial information. To accomplish this, we utilize a robust database system that supports spatial data types, namely PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension.

Project Objectives:

Retrieve Locations of Specific Features: We aim to extract precise location data for specific geographic features from our dataset.

Calculate Distance Between Points: We seek to calculate distances between various points on the map, enabling efficient distance-based analysis.

Calculate Areas of Interest: Each subgroup in our team focuses on specific areas of interest, and we aim to calculate the relevant areas for these regions.

Analyze the Queries: We will conduct an in-depth analysis of the queries used, ensuring their correctness and efficiency.

Sorting and Limiting Executions: Implementing sorting and limiting techniques to streamline query executions and manage large datasets effectively.

Optimize Query Performance: Optimizing our queries to enhance execution speed, ensuring that our GIS analysis is efficient and responsive.

N-Optimization of Queries: Further enhancing query optimization techniques to address scalability and robustness in handling large-scale data.

Presentation and GitHub Posting: We will present our project findings and codebase, making it accessible through individual GitHub repositories.

Code Functionality and Documentation: Ensuring that our code functions correctly, is well-documented, and provides clear and accurate outputs for our GIS analysis.

Project Tools and Data Source:

Database System: PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension.
Dataset Source: https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us.html 
Our project encompasses various aspects of GIS analysis, aiming to deliver a well-documented, functional, and optimized solution for geographic data analysis.
